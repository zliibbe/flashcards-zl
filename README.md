## To Play

Clone down the repo (from your GitHub). 

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
Then, to run the program, open terminal and run:

```bash
node index.js
```

This game is meant to be played entirely in the terminal. You will be asked questions that you can answer by typing the number of the answer you think is correct. You will then receive feedback as to whether your answer was 
'correct' or 'incorrect'. At the end of a round, you will receive feedback letting you know the percent of questions you've answered correctly.

## Languages Used

### JavaScript
This program runs entirely in Javascript from the terminal.
